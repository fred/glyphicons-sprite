## Sprite preview of large glyphicons icons.

Sample css and index files.

Originally taken from MaximAL's Sprite Glue project http://maximals.ru/project/sprite/glyphicons

All icons are the same size, 38x38px.

It's very very raw, no nice names in the css classes, I used just numbers.

Pull requests are welcome to add names to the css classes.

## Sample

Here is the sample html page:
